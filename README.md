# Myst

Myst is a practical dynamic language designed from experience, rather than research. The primary goals of the language are:

- **Be easy to understand:** Avoid special characters wherever possible. Expressions should flow in syntax as they do in thought. Don't surprise the user. Developers with a background in Ruby, Elixir, Crystal, or other similar languages should feel right at home, though feature parity is not a goal with any of these.
- **Be reasonably fast:** As a language that compiles to bytecode, users should expect a decent level of performance. There are no concrete goals for performance yet, but being competitive with similar languages is a long-term target.
- **Be extendable:** The compiler should be easy for users to extend. Flexibility like LISP is not a goal, but users should be able to interact with the compiler and/or VM via a direct API, rather than hacks.

More goals are sure to come as the language develops, but these are the driving points for now.


# Get Involved

Right now, Myst is a personal project, but I have no intention of keeping it that way! If you have an idea or find a bug, [file an issue for it!](https://github.com/myst-lang/myst/issues/new) If you just want to get involved in the community, [join our Discord server!](https://discord.me/myst). Any and all help is appreciated, even if that just means trying out the language for a day!
