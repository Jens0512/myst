# Myst

Myst is a practical dynamic language designed for real-world use cases. The primary goals of the language are:

- **Be easy to understand:** Avoid special characters wherever possible. Expressions should flow in syntax as they do in thought. Don't surprise the user. Developers with a background in Ruby, Elixir, Crystal, or other similar languages should feel right at home, though feature parity with any of these is not a goal.
- **Be reasonably fast:** Myst is a straight-forward, interpreted language, so it should be expected to perform competitively with similar established languages like Python and Ruby, and comparably with others like Elixir. It's okay to trade flexibility for performance.

More goals are sure to come as the language develops, but these are the driving points for now.


# Roadmap

At this point, there isn't much of a roadmap for Myst other than what is laid out in the [Syntax document](SYNTAX.md). Once a working language with basic features (simple functions, control flow, all value types) is ready, a more defined roadmap of the remaining features will be made.


# Get Involved

Right now, Myst is a personal project, but I have no intention of keeping it that way! If you have an idea or find a bug, [file an issue for it!](https://github.com/myst-lang/myst/issues/new) If you just want to get involved in the community, [join our Discord server!](https://discord.gg/8FtMeac) Any and all help is appreciated, even if that just means trying out the language for a day!
